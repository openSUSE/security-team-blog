The SUSE Security Team takes care of the security of the openSUSE Leap and
Tumbleweed distributions and SUSE products like SUSE Linux Enterprise Server
(SLES).

We regularly perform source code reviews of open source software that is part
of our products. In this blog we share technical details of security
vulnerabilities that we discovered in this process as well as otherwise
interesting security code review outcomes.

You can reach us by email at [security@suse.de](mailto:security@suse.de). Find
more detailed information about us and what we do here:
